# Fish Freshness Detection

## Introduction
This is an attempt to improve the work of  detecting "fresh fish" from the "rotten" ones. This work is done following the paper [Fish Freshness Detection Through Artificial Intelligence Approaches: A Comprehensive Study](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&as_vis=1&q=Fish+Freshness+Detection+Through+Artificial+Intelligence+Approaches%3A+A+Comprehensive+Study&btnG=).

## Things I have done here
- Done a  binary Classification
- Used Numpy and tensorfloe for image classification
- Used CNN model from Scratch
- fit the model using train data and evaluated model with validation data
- Achieved an accuracy of 99.5% on validation data
- predicted image with accurate class

## Things from where you can be beneficial
- Use the code for both binary and multi-class classification
- because of using  raw numpy array, u can use this code to apply different image processing technique  using  the numpy array (such as hog-algorthm)
- For the beginner people, this code will be extremely useful.
